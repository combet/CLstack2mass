Overview
--------

The data format used in all scripts is based on the `Astropy Table
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/>`_ format. 

Building the table
------------------

The main table is
built from the LSST DM butler as shown in the diagram [#]_ below:

For each filter `f`, an Astropy Table is create for all available
patch `p`. Since we have the same amount of patch for all filter,
which contain the exact same amount of sources, all table (1,p),
(2,p), etc., created from a patch will be of the same size for all
filter. The Astropy Tables created from all individual filters/pathes
set will then be verticaly stacked. This means that if we respecively
have `N1`, `N2` and `N3` sources for the patches 1, 2 and 3, the
output table will contains `N1` + `N2` + `N3` sources. After the first
stack, we end up with one table per filter, all containing the same
number of sources. These per-filter table are finaly stacked together
to form the final table show on the right-hand side of the diagram.

Working with the table
----------------------

Such an Asptroy table is great to work with, and can be used for all
kind of analysis in the context of our cluster study. You can apply
filters, group by column, concatenate them, etc.
