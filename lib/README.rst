Data format
-----------

The data format used in all scripts is based on the `Astropy Table
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/>`_ format. The main table is
built from the LSST DM butler as shown in the diagram [#]_ below:

For each filter `f`, an Astropy Table is create for all available
patch `p`. Since we have the same amount of patch for all filter,
which contain the exact same amount of sources, all table created from
a patch will be of the same size for all filter. Each table (1,p), (2,p), etc.
